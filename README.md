# Tripadvisor_reviews_rating_NLP

## Project Overview

I created a tool that classifies Tripadvisors reviews into three categories: negative, neutral, positive.

*   Created a tool that classifies Tripadvisors reviews into three categories (accuracy: 85%).
*   Data collection on Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews.
*   Exploratory Data analysis using Wordcloud.
*   Text preprocessing: removed punctiations, stemming, word embedding ...
*   Created a simple LSTM model.
*   Testing model for inference on one sentence.


## Code and Resources Used

**Python Version:** 3.7

**Data Collection:** https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews

## About the dataset
The dataset contains 20k reviews crawled from Tripadvisor labeled from 1 star to 5 stars. Stop words have already been removed from the reviews. This dataset can be used to predict review rating or to explore key aspects that make hotels good or bad.
